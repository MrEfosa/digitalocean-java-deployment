# Java Application Deployment on DigitalOcean

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the end-to-end process of provisioning a cloud server on DigitalOcean and deploying a Java application built with Gradle on a Linux environment. The focus is on secure server configuration, Linux user management, and real-world deployment practices.

The project reflects a typical backend / DevOps workflow used in production environments.

## Technologies Used
- **Cloud Provider:** DigitalOcean  
- **Operating System:** Linux (Ubuntu)  
- **Programming Language:** Java  
- **Build Tool:** Gradle  
- **Server Access:** SSH  

---

## Key Objectives
- Provision and configure a Linux server on DigitalOcean
- Apply security best practices for server access
- Deploy and run a Java Gradle application on a cloud server
- Gain hands-on experience with cloud infrastructure and Linux administration

---

## Server Setup & Configuration
1. Created a new DigitalOcean Droplet running Ubuntu Linux
2. Connected to the server securely via SSH
3. Created a non-root Linux user to follow security best practices
4. Configured user permissions and access controls
5. Updated system packages and installed required dependencies

---

## Application Deployment Process
1. Installed Java and Gradle on the server
2. Transferred the Java application to the Droplet
3. Built the application using Gradle
4. Successfully ran the application on the Linux server
5. Verified application execution and server stability

---

## Security Considerations
- Avoided running applications as the root user
- Used SSH-based access for secure server connections
- Followed Linux user and permission management best practices

---

## Skills Demonstrated
- Cloud infrastructure setup (DigitalOcean)
- Linux server administration
- Secure user and permission management
- Java application deployment
- Build automation using Gradle
- Basic DevOps and deployment workflows

---

## What I Learned
- How to provision and manage cloud-based Linux servers
- Best practices for securing server access
- Real-world Java application deployment
- Fundamentals of DevOps and infrastructure management

---

## Future Enhancements
- Run the application as a systemd service
- Add Docker support for containerized deployment
- Configure Nginx as a reverse proxy
- Implement CI/CD using GitHub Actions
